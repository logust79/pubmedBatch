               The ENO1 gene encodes a multifunctional enzyme that has been identified as a key component of the glycolytic pathway. Our previous studies demonstrated that ENO1 gene expression was higher in the ovaries of laying geese compared with prelaying geese. However, the molecular characterisation and expression profiling of the ENO1 gene in geese tissues and ovarian follicles remain to be determined. In this study, ENO1 cDNA (1,445 bp long) of the Sichuan white goose was cloned and characterised. The ORF of ENO1 cDNA is 1,305 bp in length and encodes a 434 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 47.27 kDa. ENO1 expression in all of the examined tissues was the highest in spleen and the lowest in breast muscle. High expression of ENO1 appeared in the kidney, liver, adrenal gland, and retina. With increasing follicle growth, ENO1 gene expression began to decrease from the small white follicle to F5, which was followed by a sharp increase in expression in F4 and then a gradual decrease in expression from F3 to F1. Furthermore, in the postovulatory follicles (POF), the levels of ENO1 gene expression decreased gradually from POF1 to POF4. In conclusion, the ENO1 transcript was widely distributed in various tissues of the Sichuan white goose, but ENO1 expression was tissue-specific. Furthermore, the results of the ENO1 expression profiling of ovarian follicles suggest that ENO1 may play an important dual role in the progress of follicular development, where ENO1 acts as a glycolytic enzyme and also mediates apoptosis.\n            ","score":1,"title":"Molecular characterisation and expression profiling of the ENO1 gene in the ovarian follicle of the Sichuan white goose.","id":"24413993"},{"title":"Analysis of IgG antibody patterns against retinal antigens and antibodies to alpha-crystallin, GFAP, and alpha-enolase in sera of patients with \"wet\" age-related macular degeneration.","abstract":"\n                The aim of this study was to compare the IgG antibody patterns against retinal antigens in sera of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and healthy subjects to learn more about possible immunological aspects of this disease and to identify some of the most important antigens.\n                Sera of 140 patients were analyzed: healthy volunteers (CO, n=101) and patients with \"wet\" age-related macular degeneration (AMD, n=39).

We identified a family who segregate novel mutations in both PITX2 (p.Ser233Leu) and FOXC1 (c.609delC). The most severely affected individual, who presented with an atypical phenotype of corneal opacification, lens extrusion, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), and subsequent bilateral retinal detachment, inherited mutations in both genes, whereas the single heterozygous mutations caused mild AR phenotypes. This is the first report of such digenic inheritance. By analyzing cognate targets of each gene, we showed that FOXC1 and PITX2 can independently regulate their own and each other's target gene promoters and do not show synergistic action in vitro. Mutation in either gene caused reduced transcriptional activation to different extents on the FOXO1 and PLOD1 promoters, whereas both mutations in combination showed the lowest level of activation. These data show how the compensatory activity of one factor, when the other is impaired, may lessen the phenotypic impact of developmental anomalies, yet reduced activity of both transcription factors increased disease severity. This suggests an under-reported mechanism for phenotypic variability whereby single mutations cause mild AR phenotypes, whereas digenic inheritance increases phenotypic severity.\n                ©

The PSC complex proteome contains 1968 proteins represented by three or more unique peptides, including approximately 1500 proteins not detected in cilia from lower organisms. This includes 105 hypothetical proteins and 60 proteins encoded by genes that map within the critical intervals for 23 inherited cilia-related disorders, increasing their priority as candidate genes. The PSC complex proteome also contains many cilia proteins not identified previously in photoreceptors, including 13 proteins produced by genes that harbor mutations that cause cilia disease and seven intraflagellar transport proteins.

The head domain may be required for targeting to the basal body and binding to a kinesin light chain. In retinal photoreceptors where rootlets appear particularly robust, rootlets extend from the basal bodies to the synaptic terminals and anchor ER membranes along their length.

RP10, due to a defect in inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1), shows autosomal dominant inheritance. Recombinantly expressed clinical mutants show unaltered kinetic behaviour. It is unclear why reportedly impaired DNA binding is important and how it would explain negative dominance. An alternative view relates to the mutant proteins' tendency to aggregate. Regarding negative dominance, a key question is whether the defective protein can subvert the function of its normal counterpart in the same cell. Potentially, the homotetrameric structure of IMPDH1 might offer a vehicle for such an effect. We have established a reliable protocol for reproducible refolding of recombinantly expressed IMPDH1 in vitro. Clinical mutants R224P and D226N both show impaired folding. For equimolar mixtures of normal and mutant enzymes, independent refolding would predict activity regain midway between pure mutant and pure normal. Under various conditions regain is close to the mutant figure, suggesting that, in hybrid tetramers, mutant subunits impose their faulty conformation on normal partners. The observed molecular recruitment is a negative counterpart of the intra-allelic complementation, also mediated via oligomeric structure and postulated many years ago by Fincham.

The activity of miR-124 and miR-29 against predicted target sites in Rdh10 and Impdh1 was tested by cotransfection of miRNA mimics and luciferase reporter plasmids.\n                Sixty-seven miRNAs were predicted to target one or more of the 320 retinal genes listed herein. All 11 candidate miRNAs tested were expressed in the retina, including miR-7, miR-124, miR135a, and miR135b. Relative levels of individual miRNAs were similar between rats and humans. The Rdh10 3'UTR, which contains a predicted miR-124 target site, mediated the inhibition of luciferase activity by miR-124 mimics in cell culture.\n                Many miRNAs likely to regulate genes important for retinal function are present in the retina.

IMPDH1 is a highly conserved, widely expressed housekeeping gene, the product of which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of de novo guanine synthesis. Despite its conservation and ubiquity, the clinical consequences of missense mutations in IMPDH1 are limited to the retina, and the disease mechanism is currently unknown.\n                A variety of methods were used to address the unique features of IMPDH1 in the retina, including Northern blot analysis, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), immunohistochemistry, transcript sequencing, and Western blot analysis.\n                Results of the experiments showed that IMPDH1 levels are higher in the retina than in any other tissue tested. Specifically, IMPDH1 is found predominately in the inner segment and synaptic terminals of retinal photoreceptors. The predominant transcripts of IMPDH1 in human retina are the result of alternate splicing and alternate start sites of translation. They are significantly different from those in other tissues, and these variant transcripts encode distinct proteins. Further, the proportions of IMPDH1 transcripts and proteins in human retina are different from those in mouse retina.\n                Identification of unique retinal isoforms supports the existence of a novel IMPDH1 function in the retina, one that is probably altered by disease-causing mutations.

This revealed a series of transcripts, of which some were derived from genes known to map at retinopathy loci, levels of which were reduced or elevated in the retinas of Rho(-/-) mice lacking functional photoreceptors. The human homologue of one of these genes, encoding inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase type 1 (IMPDH1), maps to the region of 7q to which an adRP gene (RP10) had previously been localized. Mutational screening of DNA from the Spanish adRP family, originally used to localize the RP10 gene, revealed an Arg224Pro substitution co-segregating with the disease phenotype. The amino acid at position 224 of the IMPDH1 protein is conserved among species and the substitution is not present in healthy, unrelated individuals of European origin. These data provide strong evidence that mutations within the IMPDH1 gene cause adRP, and validate approaches to mutation detection involving comparative analysis of global transcription profiles in normal and degenerating retinal tissues. Other genes showing significant alterations in expression include some with anti-apoptotic functions and many encoding components of the extracellular matrix or cytoskeleton, a possible reflection of a response by Muller cells to preserve the remaining outer nuclear layer of the retina. We suggest that those genes identified are prime candidates for etiological involvement in degenerative retinal disease.\n            ","title":"Identification of an IMPDH1 mutation in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP10) revealed following comparative microarray analysis of transcripts derived from retinas of wild-type and Rho(-/-) mice."}]},"LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred":"D","HUGO.no.splice.info":"IMPDH1","X1000g2012apr_ALL":"NA","LJB_MutationTaster_Pred":"D","cg69":"NA","clean.signature":"7_128034332_G_A","rare":"TRUE","Start":"128034332","Samples":"113","LJB_LRT":"0.999892","is.indel":"FALSE","non.syn":"TRUE","HUGO":"IMPDH1","non.ref.calls.controls":"0","non.missing.controls":"2512","pred_score":1000,"LJB_PhyloP_Pred":"C","QUAL":"104.05","ExonicFunc":"nonsynonymous SNV","core.splicing":"FALSE","Ref":"G","Gene":"ENSG00000106348;ENSG00000106348","dup.region":"FALSE","freq.cases":"0.008849558","missing.rate.cases":"0.00877193","pubmed_score":181,"IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001":"0|1:8","End":"128034332","non.missing.external.controls":"830","splicing":"FALSE","indel.length":"0","dbSNP137":"","remove.bad.transcripts":"FALSE","Omim":"146690","somewhat.rare":"TRUE","LJB_MutationTaster":"0.999996","LJB_GERP..":"4.79","Func":"exonic;splicing","freq.external.controls":"0","LJB_PolyPhen2":"0.979","ensemblID":"ENSG00000106348","non.ref.calls.cases":"2","non.ref.calls.external.controls":"0","novel":"TRUE","lof":"FALSE","signature":"7_128034332_G_A","exonic.splicing":"TRUE","LJB_SIFT_Pred":"D","LJB_LRT_Pred":"U","SegDup":"NA","Description":"IMP (inosine 5'-monophosphate) dehydrogenase 1","Obs":"A","Conserved":"503;Name=lod=147","LJB_SIFT":"1","Chr":"7","AVSIFT":"0","FILTER":"VQSRTrancheSNP99.60to99.80"},{"LJB_SIFT_Pred":"D","LJB_LRT_Pred":"N","SegDup":"NA","Obs":"T","Description":"coagulation factor VIII, procoagulant component","Conserved":"","LJB_SIFT":"0.96","AVSIFT":"0.21","Chr":"X","FILTER":"PASS","LJB_PolyPhen2":"0","freq.external.controls":"0","Func":"exonic","ensemblID":"ENSG00000185010","non.ref.calls.external.controls":"0","non.ref.calls.cases":"2","novel":"TRUE","signature":"X_154158743_C_T","lof":"FALSE","exonic.splicing":"FALSE","splicing":"FALSE","indel.length":"0","remove.bad.transcripts":"FALSE","Omim":"306700","dbSNP137":"","somewhat.rare":"TRUE","LJB_MutationTaster":"0.001419","LJB_GERP..":"1.35","core.splicing":"FALSE","Ref":"C","Gene":"ENSG00000185010","dup.region":"FALSE","freq.cases":"0.008849558","pubmed_score":59,"missing.rate.cases":"0.00877193","non.missing.external.controls":"827","End":"154158743","IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001":"1|1:30","is.indel":"FALSE","HUGO":"F8","non.syn":"TRUE","non.missing.controls":"2466","non.ref.calls.controls":"0","pred_score":10,"ExonicFunc":"nonsynonymous SNV","QUAL":"816.04","LJB_PhyloP_Pred":"N","clean.signature":"X_154158743_C_T","rare":"TRUE","Start":"154158743","Samples":"114","LJB_LRT":"0.27131","ensemblID.bis":"NA","ref(pubmedID)":{"total_score":"59","known":0,"results":[{"id":"25116775","abstract":"\n                Purpose : To review the characteristics and outcomes of patients who underwent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with scleral depressed vitreous shaving, 360 degree peripheral endolaser, and 14% C3F8 gas for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).

However, if the families were grouped according to their proband's phenotype BPI or BPII, a susceptibility gene for BPI disorder at the DXS52-F8 cluster could not be excluded.\n            ","id":"7726217"},{"title":"[Treatment of coloboma pitS of the optic nerve complicated by serous detachment of the neuroepithelium].","abstract":"\n                The pathogenesis of the sensory retinal detachment of the macula associated with congenital pit of the optic nerve remains controversal. Based on our cases and the cases reported in literature, we propose a management plan for macular retinal detachment associated with optic nerve pit.\n                In this retrospective study ten eyes were treated for progressive visual loss. Treatment modalities were different depending on the time period: laser photocoagulation (to the juxtapapillary region) alone, laser combined with intraocular gas injection (C3 F8), laser combined with vitrectomy and intraocular gas tamponnade (S F6, C3 F8), laser combined with vitrectomy and temporary silicone oil tamponade.\n                The follow-up period ranged between one and five years (mean follow-up thirty three months). We had eight successes and two definitive failures (an old macular detachment treated only by one laser session, and a young girl who had not kept the prone position after gas injection). In the group of six eyes treated by laser alone, only two retinal treatments were directly successfully treated; in three other eyes, the detachment recurred and was treated with success in a second step by a gas injection; the sixth eye is the first definitive failure (old detachment). In the five eyes treated by laser combined gas injection with or without pars plana vitrectomy (including three failures of laser alone), the retina remained attached in four eyes during the follow-up period; the sixth eye was the second definitive failure (the young girl). In the both eyes treated by vitrectomy and silicon oil injection, the retina has flattened.\n                The results suggest that laser photocoagulation alone is not so efficient and that vitrectomy is not necessary with gas injection. Complete resorption of subretinal fluid occurred in eight eyes: two with laser photocoagulation alone, and six with a long term tamponnade combined with a peripapillary laser photocoagulation. In first treatment, this technique (laser with tamponade) is a valuable approach to manage serous macular detachment associated with optic nerve pit.\n            ","score":9,"id":"7822694"},{"id":"2879932","title":"Linkage analysis using multiple Xq DNA polymorphisms in normal families, families with the fragile X syndrome, and other families with X linked conditions.","abstract":"\n                Multipoint linkage analysis was undertaken with eight Xq cloned DNA sequences which identify one or more restriction fragment length polymorphisms in 26 families. These families comprise seven phase known normal families with three or more males in the third generation, seven families segregating for haemophilia B, one large family with dyskeratosis congenita, and 11 families with the fragile X syndrome. Phase known meioses informative for three or more loci supported the order centromere--DXYS1--DXS107--DXS102, DXS51--F9--FRAXA--DXS15, DXS52, F8--Xqter in each group of families studied. One of the normal families was segregating for protan colour blindness and showed a phase known recombination which would support the order centromere--F9--DXS52--CBP--Xqter. With the exception of DXYS1, all of these sequences have been localised to Xq27----qter by in situ hybridisation or hybridisation to Xq fragment panels, and on this basis should lie within 20 cM of one another. No recombination was observed between the sequences localised to Xq28, namely DXS52, F8, and DXS15 (between DXS15 and DXS52 Z = 12.25 at theta = 0 with confidence limits of 0 to 5 cM). However, an excess of recombination was apparent in the region of FRAXA with maximal lod scores as follows: F9 versus FRAXA (Z = 2.05, theta = 0.19), DXS52 versus FRAXA (Z = 1.85, theta = 0.26), and DXS15 versus FRAXA (Z = 1.33, theta = 0.27). No consistent differences were observed in the frequency of recombination when families with the fragile X syndrome were compared with normal families or families segregating for other X linked conditions. These results are compared with other published work and support the conclusion that although measurable linkage exists between these flanking markers and FRAXA, the intervals as measured by the frequency of meiotic recombination will seriously limit their clinical usefulness.\n            ","score":1},{"id":"7425922","title":"Intravitreal longevity of three perfluorocarbon gases.","abstract":"\n                Three gases, perfluoromethane, perfluoroethane, and perfluoropropane (CF4, C2F6, and C3 F8, respectively) were studied for their possible value as intravitreal tamponades in retinal surgery.
