RP10, due to a defect in inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1), shows autosomal dominant inheritance. Recombinantly expressed clinical mutants show unaltered kinetic behaviour. It is unclear why reportedly impaired DNA binding is important and how it would explain negative dominance. An alternative view relates to the mutant proteins' tendency to aggregate. Regarding negative dominance, a key question is whether the defective protein can subvert the function of its normal counterpart in the same cell. Potentially, the homotetrameric structure of IMPDH1 might offer a vehicle for such an effect. We have established a reliable protocol for reproducible refolding of recombinantly expressed IMPDH1 in vitro. Clinical mutants R224P and D226N both show impaired folding. For equimolar mixtures of normal and mutant enzymes, independent refolding would predict activity regain midway between pure mutant and pure normal. Under various conditions regain is close to the mutant figure, suggesting that, in hybrid tetramers, mutant subunits impose their faulty conformation on normal partners. The observed molecular recruitment is a negative counterpart of the intra-allelic complementation, also mediated via oligomeric structure and postulated many years ago by Fincham. These findings appear potentially to account for the negative dominant inheritance. This interpretation must be provisional at present, as the predominant transcript in retina is an alternatively spliced version not fully identical to that used in our study. The results nevertheless have a general significance in pointing to a mechanism for negative dominance that could be widespread.\n                2011 Elsevier B.V.

We show that AAV-mediated co-expression in the murine retina of a mutant human IMPDH1 gene together with short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) validated in vitro and in vivo, targeting both human and mouse IMPDH1, substantially suppresses the negative pathological effects of mutant IMPDH1, at a point where, in the absence of shRNA, expression of mutant protein in the RP10 model essentially ablates all photoreceptors in transfected areas of the retina.

One locus, the RP10 form of adRP, maps to human chromosome 7q31.1 and may account for 5-10% of adRP cases among Americans and Europeans. We identified two American families with the RP10 form of adRP by linkage mapping and used these families to reduce the linkage interval to 3.45 Mb between the flanking markers D7S686 and RP-STR8. Sequence and transcript analysis identified 54 independent genes within this region, at least 10 of which are retinal-expressed and thus candidates for the RP10 gene. A screen of retinal transcripts comparing retinas from normal mice to retinas from crx-/crx- knockout mice (with poorly differentiated photoreceptors) demonstrated a 6-fold reduction in one candidate, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1; EC 1.1.1.205). Since many of the genes known to cause retinitis pigmentosa are under CRX control in photoreceptors, IMPDH1 became a high-priority candidate for mutation screening. DNA sequencing of affected individuals from the two American RP10 families revealed a GAC-->AAC transition in codon 226 substituting an asparagine for an aspartic acid in both families. The identical mutation was also found in a British RP10 family. The Asp226Asn missense mutation is present in all affected individuals tested and absent from unaffected controls. The aspartic acid at codon 226 is conserved in all IMPDH genes, in all species examined, including bacteria, suggesting that this mutation is highly deleterious. Subsequent screening of probands from 60 other adRP families revealed an additional family with this mutation, confirming its association with retinitis pigmentosa and the relatively high frequency of this mutation. Another IMPDH1 substitution, Val268Ile, was also observed in this cohort of patients but not in controls. IMPDH1 is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme, functioning as a homotetramer, which catalyzed the rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. As such, it plays an important role in cyclic nucleoside metabolism within photoreceptors. Several classes of drugs are known to affect IMPDH isoenzymes, including nucleotide and NAD analogs, suggesting that small-molecule therapy may be available, one day, for RP10 patients.\n            ","title":"Mutations in the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IMPDH1) cause the RP10 form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.","id":"11875050","score":6},{"id":"11875049","score":4,"abstract":"\n                Comparative analysis of the transcriptional profiles of approximately 6000 genes in the retinas of wild-type mice with those carrying a targeted disruption of the rhodopsin gene was undertaken by microarray analysis. This revealed a series of transcripts, of which some were derived from genes known to map at retinopathy loci, levels of which were reduced or elevated in the retinas of Rho(-/-) mice lacking functional photoreceptors. The human homologue of one of these genes, encoding inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase type 1 (IMPDH1), maps to the region of 7q to which an adRP gene (RP10) had previously been localized. Mutational screening of DNA from the Spanish adRP family, originally used to localize the RP10 gene, revealed an Arg224Pro substitution co-segregating with the disease phenotype. The amino acid at position 224 of the IMPDH1 protein is conserved among species and the substitution is not present in healthy, unrelated individuals of European origin. These data provide strong evidence that mutations within the IMPDH1 gene cause adRP, and validate approaches to mutation detection involving comparative analysis of global transcription profiles in normal and degenerating retinal tissues. Other genes showing significant alterations in expression include some with anti-apoptotic functions and many encoding components of the extracellular matrix or cytoskeleton, a possible reflection of a response by Muller cells to preserve the remaining outer nuclear layer of the retina. We suggest that those genes identified are prime candidates for etiological involvement in degenerative retinal disease.\n            ","title":"Identification of an IMPDH1 mutation in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP10) revealed following comparative microarray analysis of transcripts derived from retinas of wild-type and Rho(-/-) mice."}]},"LJB_LRT_Pred":"U","novel":"TRUE","non.ref.calls.external.controls":"0","missing.rate.cases":"0.0087719298","LJB_SIFT_Pred":"D","remove.bad.transcripts":"FALSE","Samples":"IRDC_batch2_LON_2016_GC18922;IRDC_batch5_OXF_3023","non.missing.controls":"2512","clean.signature":"7_128034332_G_A","core.splicing":"FALSE","ensemblID.bis":"NA","dup.region":"FALSE","exonic.splicing":"TRUE","HUGO":"IMPDH1","non.missing.cases":"113","Chr":"7","pred_score":1000,"LJB_SIFT":"1","HUGO.no.splice.info":"IMPDH1","non.ref.calls.cases":"2","SegDup":"NA","Omim":"146690","freq.cases":"0.0088495575","freq.controls":"0","lof":"FALSE","Func":"exonic;splicing","indel.length":"0","somewhat.rare":"TRUE","cg69":"NA","LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred":"D","LJB_MutationTaster_Pred":"D","Description":"IMP (inosine 5'-monophosphate) dehydrogenase 1","IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001":"0|1:8","Ref":"G","AVSIFT":"0","LJB_MutationTaster":"0.999996","X1000g2012apr_ALL":"NA","LJB_PhyloP":"0.999329","pubmed_score":131,"non.missing.external.controls":"830","ESP6500si_ALL":"NA","End":"128034332","LJB_PolyPhen2":"0.979","ncarriers.cases":"2","ensemblID":"ENSG00000106348","is.indel":"FALSE","freq.external.controls":"0","LJB_PhyloP_Pred":"C","QUAL":"104.05","non.syn":"TRUE","signature":"7_128034332_G_A","Conserved":"503;Name=lod=147","potential.comp.het":"FALSE","dbSNP137":"","AAChange":"ENSG00000106348:ENST00000496200:exon12:c.C1448T:p.S483F,ENSG00000106348:ENST00000343214:exon13:c.C1448T:p.S483F,ENSG00000106348:ENST00000378717:exon13:c.C1571T:p.S524F,ENSG00000106348:ENST00000470772:exon13:c.C1520T:p.S507F,ENSG00000106348:ENST00000480861:exon13:c.C1508T:p.S503F,ENSG00000106348:ENST00000348127:exon14:c.C1670T:p.S557F,ENSG00000106348:ENST00000354269:exon15:c.C1748T:p.S583F,ENSG00000106348:ENST00000419067:exon15:c.C1679T:p.S560F,ENSG00000106348:ENST00000338791:exon16:c.C1778T:p.S593F","LJB_GERP..":"4.79","FILTER":"VQSRTrancheSNP99.60to99.80","Start":"128034332","LJB_LRT":"0.999892"},{"core.splicing":"FALSE","dup.region":"FALSE","exonic.splicing":"FALSE","ensemblID.bis":"NA","HUGO.no.splice.info":"F8","non.missing.cases":"113","pred_score":10,"Chr":"X","HUGO":"F8","LJB_SIFT":"0.96","SegDup":"NA","non.ref.calls.cases":"2","Omim":"306700","splicing":"FALSE","Obs":"T","rare":"TRUE","non.ref.calls.controls":"0","LJB_LRT_Pred":"N","novel":"TRUE","ExonicFunc":"nonsynonymous SNV","Gene":"ENSG00000185010","ref(pubmedID)":{"total_score":"1","known":0,"results":[{"score":1,"id":"7726217","title":"Linkage analysis of bipolar illness with X-chromosome DNA markers: a susceptibility gene in Xq27-q28 cannot be excluded.","abstract":"\n                Transmission studies have supported the presence of a susceptibility gene for bipolar (BP) illness on the X-chromosome. Initial linkage studies with color blindness (CB), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and the blood coagulation factor IX (F9) have suggested that a gene for BP illness is located in the Xq27-q28 region. We tested linkage with several DNA markers located in Xq27-q28 in 2 families, MAD3 and MAD4, that previously were linked to F9 and 7 newly ascertained families of BP probands. Linkage was also examined with the gene encoding the alpha 3 subunit of the gamma-amino butyric acid receptor (GABRA3), a candidate gene for BP illness located in this region. The genetic data were analyzed with the LOD score method using age-dependent penetrance of an autosomal dominant disease gene and narrow and broad clinical models. In MAD3 and MAD4 the multipoint LOD score data suggested a localization of a BPI gene again near F9. In the 7 new families the overall linkage data excluded the Xq27-q28 region.
