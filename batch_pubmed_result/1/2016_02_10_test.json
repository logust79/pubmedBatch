been identified as a key component of the glycolytic pathway. Our previous studies demonstrated that ENO1 gene expression was higher in the ovaries of laying geese compared with prelaying geese. However, the molecular characterisation and expression profiling of the ENO1 gene in geese tissues and ovarian follicles remain to be determined. In this study, ENO1 cDNA (1,445 bp long) of the Sichuan white goose was cloned and characterised. The ORF of ENO1 cDNA is 1,305 bp in length and encodes a 434 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 47.27 kDa. ENO1 expression in all of the examined tissues was the highest in spleen and the lowest in breast muscle. High expression of ENO1 appeared in the kidney, liver, adrenal gland, and retina. With increasing follicle growth, ENO1 gene expression began to decrease from the small white follicle to F5, which was followed by a sharp increase in expression in F4 and then a gradual decrease in expression from F3 to F1. Furthermore, in the postovulatory follicles (POF), the levels of ENO1 gene expression decreased gradually from POF1 to POF4. In conclusion, the ENO1 transcript was widely distributed in various tissues of the Sichuan white goose, but ENO1 expression was tissue-specific. Furthermore, the results of the ENO1 expression profiling of ovarian follicles suggest that ENO1 may play an important dual role in the progress of follicular development, where ENO1 acts as a glycolytic enzyme and also mediates apoptosis.\n            "},{"id":"17058093","score":9,"abstract":"\n                The aim of this study was to compare the IgG antibody patterns against retinal antigens in sera of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and healthy subjects to learn more about possible immunological aspects of this disease and to identify some of the most important antigens.\n                Sera of 140 patients were analyzed: healthy volunteers (CO, n=101) and patients with \"wet\" age-related macular degeneration (AMD, n=39).

We identified a family who segregate novel mutations in both PITX2 (p.Ser233Leu) and FOXC1 (c.609delC). The most severely affected individual, who presented with an atypical phenotype of corneal opacification, lens extrusion, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), and subsequent bilateral retinal detachment, inherited mutations in both genes, whereas the single heterozygous mutations caused mild AR phenotypes. This is the first report of such digenic inheritance. By analyzing cognate targets of each gene, we showed that FOXC1 and PITX2 can independently regulate their own and each other's target gene promoters and do not show synergistic action in vitro. Mutation in either gene caused reduced transcriptional activation to different extents on the FOXO1 and PLOD1 promoters, whereas both mutations in combination showed the lowest level of activation. These data show how the compensatory activity of one factor, when the other is impaired, may lessen the phenotypic impact of developmental anomalies, yet reduced activity of both transcription factors increased disease severity. This suggests an under-reported mechanism for phenotypic variability whereby single mutations cause mild AR phenotypes, whereas digenic inheritance increases phenotypic severity.\n                Â©

Mutations in genes that encode cilia components are common causes of disease, including retinal degenerations. The protein components of mammalian primary and sensory cilia have not been defined previously. Here we report a detailed proteomics analysis of the mouse PSC complex. The PSC complex comprises the outer segment and its cytoskeleton, including the axoneme, basal body, and ciliary rootlet, which extends into the inner segment of photoreceptor cells. The PSC complex proteome contains 1968 proteins represented by three or more unique peptides, including approximately 1500 proteins not detected in cilia from lower organisms. This includes 105 hypothetical proteins and 60 proteins encoded by genes that map within the critical intervals for 23 inherited cilia-related disorders, increasing their priority as candidate genes. The PSC complex proteome also contains many cilia proteins not identified previously in photoreceptors, including 13 proteins produced by genes that harbor mutations that cause cilia disease and seven intraflagellar transport proteins. Analyses of PSC complexes from rootletin knock-out mice, which lack ciliary rootlets, confirmed that 1185 of the identified PSC complex proteins are derived from the outer segment. The mass spectrometry data, benchmarked by 15 well characterized outer segment proteins, were used to quantify the copy number of each protein in a mouse rod outer segment.

Recombinant rootletin forms detergent-insoluble filaments radiating from the centrioles and resembling rootlets found in vivo. An mAb widely used as a marker for vertebrate rootlets recognizes an epitope in rootletin. Rootletin has a globular head domain and a tail domain consisting of extended coiled-coil structures. Rootletin forms parallel in register homodimers and elongated higher order polymers mediated by the tail domain alone. The head domain may be required for targeting to the basal body and binding to a kinesin light chain. In retinal photoreceptors where rootlets appear particularly robust, rootlets extend from the basal bodies to the synaptic terminals and anchor ER membranes along their length. Our data indicate that rootlets are composed of homopolymeric rootletin protofilaments bundled into variably shaped thick filaments.

               The French Canadian population of Quebec is a unique, well-known founder population with religious, linguistic, and geographic isolation. The genetics of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in Quebec is not well studied thus far. The purpose of our study was to establish the genetic architecture of autosomal dominant RP (adRP) and to characterize the phenotypes associated with new adRP mutations in Quebec.\n                Sanger sequencing of the commonly mutated currently known adRP genes was performed in a clinically well-characterized cohort of 60 adRP French Canadian families. Phenotypes were analyzed by projected visual acuity (best corrected), Goldmann visual fields, optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and ERG. The potential effect of the novel mutations was assessed using in silico bioinformatic tools. The pathogenicity of all variants was then confirmed by segregation analysis within the families, when available.\n                We identified the causal mutation/gene in 24 of our adRP families, as 24 (40%) of 60 patients had adRP mutations in six known adRP genes. Eleven (46%) of these mutations were in RHO, four mutations (17%) were found in SNRNP200, three mutations (12.5%) in PRPH2/RDS, three mutations (12.5%) in TOPORS, two mutations (8%) in PRPF31, and one mutation (4%) in IMPDH1. Four mutations were novel. We identified new mutations in RHO (p.S270I), PRPF31 (p.R288W), IMPDH1 (p.Q318H), and TOPORS (p.H889R); the rest were previously reported. We present the genotype-phenotype characteristics of the four novel missense mutations.\n                This is the first large screening of adRP genes in the founder population of Quebec. Our prevalence of known adRP genes is 40% in the French Canadian population, which is lower than in other adRP populations around the world, illustrating the uniqueness of the French Canadian population.

Comparative WES analysis showed a new variant (p.Gly103Arg in the COL6A6 gene) that segregated with the disease in one family with adRP. As this variant was linked with the RHO locus, we sequenced the complete RHO gene, which revealed a deletion in intron 4 that encompassed all of exon 5 and 28 bp of the 3'-untranslated region (UTR).\n                The novel multiplex PCR assay with next-generation sequencing (NGS) proved effective for detecting most of the adRP-causing mutations. A WES approach led to identification of a deletion in RHO through detection of a new linked variant in COL6A6. No pathogenic variants were identified in the remaining three families. Moreover, NGS and WES were inefficient for detecting the complete deletion of exon 5 in the RHO gene in one family with adRP.

A protease protection assay suggested isoform-specific purine nucleotide binding characteristics, with ATP protecting IMPDH1 and AMP protecting IMPDH2, via a mechanism involving conformational changes upon nucleotide binding to the Bateman domain without affecting IMPDH catalytic activity. ATP binding to IMPDH1 was confirmed in a nucleotide binding assay.

It is unclear why reportedly impaired DNA binding is important and how it would explain negative dominance. An alternative view relates to the mutant proteins' tendency to aggregate. Regarding negative dominance, a key question is whether the defective protein can subvert the function of its normal counterpart in the same cell. Potentially, the homotetrameric structure of IMPDH1 might offer a vehicle for such an effect. We have established a reliable protocol for reproducible refolding of recombinantly expressed IMPDH1 in vitro. Clinical mutants R224P and D226N both show impaired folding. For equimolar mixtures of normal and mutant enzymes, independent refolding would predict activity regain midway between pure mutant and pure normal. Under various conditions regain is close to the mutant figure, suggesting that, in hybrid tetramers, mutant subunits impose their faulty conformation on normal partners. The observed molecular recruitment is a negative counterpart of the intra-allelic complementation, also mediated via oligomeric structure and postulated many years ago by Fincham. These findings appear potentially to account for the negative dominant inheritance.

Candidate disease loci include RP10 (IMPDH1) and uncharacterised Ushers (USH1E) and glaucoma (GLC1F) loci.\n            ","title":"Genetic, ophthalmic, morphometric and histopathological analysis of the Retinopathy Globe Enlarged (rge) chicken.","score":2,"id":"12847422"},{"score":6,"id":"11875050","title":"Mutations in the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IMPDH1) cause the RP10 form of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.","abstract":"\n                Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) is a heterogeneous set of progressive retinopathies caused by several distinct genes. One locus, the RP10 form of adRP, maps to human chromosome 7q31.1 and may account for 5-10% of adRP cases among Americans and Europeans. We identified two American families with the RP10 form of adRP by linkage mapping and used these families to reduce the linkage interval to 3.45 Mb between the flanking markers D7S686 and RP-STR8. Sequence and transcript analysis identified 54 independent genes within this region, at least 10 of which are retinal-expressed and thus candidates for the RP10 gene. A screen of retinal transcripts comparing retinas from normal mice to retinas from crx-/crx- knockout mice (with poorly differentiated photoreceptors) demonstrated a 6-fold reduction in one candidate, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1; EC 1.1.1.205). Since many of the genes known to cause retinitis pigmentosa are under CRX control in photoreceptors, IMPDH1 became a high-priority candidate for mutation screening. DNA sequencing of affected individuals from the two American RP10 families revealed a GAC-->AAC transition in codon 226 substituting an asparagine for an aspartic acid in both families. The identical mutation was also found in a British RP10 family. The Asp226Asn missense mutation is present in all affected individuals tested and absent from unaffected controls. The aspartic acid at codon 226 is conserved in all IMPDH genes, in all species examined, including bacteria, suggesting that this mutation is highly deleterious. Subsequent screening of probands from 60 other adRP families revealed an additional family with this mutation, confirming its association with retinitis pigmentosa and the relatively high frequency of this mutation. Another IMPDH1 substitution, Val268Ile, was also observed in this cohort of patients but not in controls. IMPDH1 is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme, functioning as a homotetramer, which catalyzed the rate-limiting step in de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. As such, it plays an important role in cyclic nucleoside metabolism within photoreceptors. Several classes of drugs are known to affect IMPDH isoenzymes, including nucleotide and NAD analogs, suggesting that small-molecule therapy may be available, one day, for RP10 patients.\n            "},{"title":"Identification of an IMPDH1 mutation in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP10) revealed following comparative microarray analysis of transcripts derived from retinas of wild-type and Rho(-/-) mice.","abstract":"\n                Comparative analysis of the transcriptional profiles of approximately 6000 genes in the retinas of wild-type mice with those carrying a targeted disruption of the rhodopsin gene was undertaken by microarray analysis. This revealed a series of transcripts, of which some were derived from genes known to map at retinopathy loci, levels of which were reduced or elevated in the retinas of Rho(-/-) mice lacking functional photoreceptors. The human homologue of one of these genes, encoding inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase type 1 (IMPDH1), maps to the region of 7q to which an adRP gene (RP10) had previously been localized. Mutational screening of DNA from the Spanish adRP family, originally used to localize the RP10 gene, revealed an Arg224Pro substitution co-segregating with the disease phenotype. The amino acid at position 224 of the IMPDH1 protein is conserved among species and the substitution is not present in healthy, unrelated individuals of European origin. These data provide strong evidence that mutations within the IMPDH1 gene cause adRP, and validate approaches to mutation detection involving comparative analysis of global transcription profiles in normal and degenerating retinal tissues. Other genes showing significant alterations in expression include some with anti-apoptotic functions and many encoding components of the extracellular matrix or cytoskeleton, a possible reflection of a response by Muller cells to preserve the remaining outer nuclear layer of the retina. We suggest that those genes identified are prime candidates for etiological involvement in degenerative retinal disease.\n            ","score":4,"id":"11875049"}],"known":1,"total_score":"181"},"splicing":"FALSE","Conserved":"503;Name=lod=147","Start":"128034332","ensemblID":"ENSG00000106348","Obs":"A","SegDup":"NA","Func":"exonic;splicing","ensemblID.bis":"NA","missing.rate.cases":"0.0087719298","ESP6500si_ALL":"NA","X1000g2012apr_ALL":"NA","non.missing.cases":"113","AVSIFT":"0","freq.controls":"0","non.ref.calls.controls":"0","End":"128034332","non.missing.external.controls":"830","IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001":"0|1:8","rare":"TRUE","HUGO.no.splice.info":"IMPDH1","non.syn":"TRUE","LJB_MutationTaster":"0.999996","FILTER":"VQSRTrancheSNP99.60to99.80","somewhat.rare":"TRUE","Samples":"IRDC_batch2_LON_2016_GC18922;IRDC_batch5_OXF_3023","core.splicing":"FALSE","ncarriers.cases":"2","is.indel":"FALSE","LJB_SIFT":"1","Chr":"7","signature":"7_128034332_G_A","non.ref.calls.cases":"2","pubmed_score":181,"Ref":"G","LJB_LRT":"0.999892","dup.region":"FALSE","clean.signature":"7_128034332_G_A","Gene":"ENSG00000106348;ENSG00000106348","novel":"TRUE","ExonicFunc":"nonsynonymous SNV"},{"pred_score":10,"freq.cases":"0.0088495575","non.ref.calls.external.controls":"0","LJB_LRT_Pred":"N","QUAL":"816.04","remove.bad.transcripts":"FALSE","LJB_PolyPhen2":"0","Description":"coagulation factor VIII, procoagulant component","freq.external.controls":"0","indel.length":"0","Omim":"306700","LJB_PolyPhen2_Pred":"B","cg69":"NA","HUGO":"F8","dbSNP137":"","ensemblID":"ENSG00000185010","SegDup":"NA","Obs":"T","Func":"exonic","ref(pubmedID)":{"total_score":0,"results":["masked"]},"Conserved":"","splicing":"FALSE","Start":"154158743","LJB_SIFT_Pred":"D","potential.comp.het":"FALSE","LJB_PhyloP":"0.809028","exonic.splicing":"FALSE","non.missing.controls":"2466","LJB_PhyloP_Pred":"N","LJB_MutationTaster_Pred":"N","LJB_GERP..":"1.35","AAChange":"ENSG00000185010:ENST00000360256:exon14:c.G3322A:p.A1108T","lof":"FALSE","LJB_MutationTaster":"0.001419","IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001":"1|1:30","rare":"TRUE","non.syn":"TRUE","HUGO.no.splice.info":"F8","non.ref.calls.controls":"0","End":"154158743","non.missing.external.controls":"827","ensemblID.bis":"NA","missing.rate.cases":"0.0087719298","ESP6500si_ALL":"NA","AVSIFT":"0.21","non.missing.cases":"113","X1000g2012apr_ALL":"NA","freq.controls":"0","Gene":"ENSG00000185010","dup.region":"FALSE","clean.signature":"X_154158743_C_T","novel":"TRUE","ExonicFunc":"nonsynonymous SNV","non.ref.calls.cases":"2","signature":"X_154158743_C_T","pubmed_score":0,"LJB_LRT":"0.27131","Ref":"C","is.indel":"FALSE","ncarriers.cases":"1","core.splicing":"FALSE","LJB_SIFT":"0.96","Chr":"X","FILTER":"PASS","somewhat.rare":"TRUE","Samples":"IRDC_batch2_OXF_3001"}]]
